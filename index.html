					<h3>Data Science</h3>
					<p>I am studying a dual-degree in Data Science at Duke University (USA) and
					Duke Kunshan University (China).
					I have also worked on many personal projects and competitions where I was able
					to predict the stock market performance and analyze the economic impact of
					COVID-19 in the US. As a result, I have acquired proficiency in SQL, Python,
					and data science libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and sci-kit learn.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "service">
					<h3>AI & Machine Learning</h3>
					<p>AI & Machine Learning is a vital part of my program, besides, I have completed
					the IBM specialization in AI Engineering. I am able to train and deploy Machine
					Learning algorithms for Object Detection, Image Recognition, Classification, Pattern
					Recognition, and Clustering. I have also implemented these algorithms in my personal
					projects and research using TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, and Keras.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "service">
					<h3>Research</h3>
					<p>I have worked on a particle physics related project at the Duke Department
					of Physics with Fritz London Distinguished Professor Ashutosh V. Kotwal. We implemented
					AI algorithms in C/C++ directly into integrated circuits. To allow the Large Hadron
					Collider (LHC) at CERN to detect the production of Dark Matter particles. Currently working
					with Prof. Luyao Zhang at the Data Science Research Center on Qunatitative trading AI algorithms.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "service">
					<h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>
					<p>In 2020, my teammates and I were National Finalists of the Alibaba GET Global Challenge, this
					is a global competition for young entrepreneurs. Our project was Frontiers of Health, a platform
					that offers high-quality & low-cost psychological services to students.</p>
