					<h3>Software Development</h3>
					<p>
						I interned at Amazon Web Services in my junior year. I worked in the
						development of a monitoring application for the AWS Lambda Science team.
						During my time there, I worked and collaborated with Engineers and Research
						Scientists and developed my skills on AWS services such as <strong>EC2</strong>,
						<strong>S3</strong>, <strong>ERC</strong>, and <strong>Lambda</strong>. I
						have also worked on independent projects where I used <strong>Java</strong>,
						<strong>Python</strong>, <strong>C/C++</strong>, and <strong>SQL</strong>. My
						project saved 100+ hours to engineers and helped to increase AWS Lambda availability
						by 5%.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "service">
					<h3>Data Science</h3>
					<p>
						Dual-degree in Data Science at Duke University (USA) and
						Duke Kunshan University (China). I have worked on several research
						projects in Physics and Economics, including a paper for the workshop at the
						<strong>IEEE Blockchain 2022 Conference</strong>. These and other experiences
						have allowed me to acquire proficiency in data science libraries
						such as <strong>NumPy</strong>, <strong>Pandas</strong>, <strong>SciPy</strong>,
						<strong>Matplotlib</strong>, and <strong>Scikit learn</strong>. As well as
						learning to use <strong>Plotly</strong>, <strong>Tableau</strong>, and <strong>QuickSight</strong>
						to create interactive dashboards.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "service">
					<h3>AI & Machine Learning</h3>
					<p>
						AI & Machine Learning is a vital part of my major and research, besides, I have completed
						the IBM specialization in AI Engineering. I have trained and deployed Supervised, Unsupervised,
						and Recursive Machine Learning algorithms for <strong>Object Detection</strong>,
						<strong>Image Recognition</strong>, <strong>Classification</strong>,
						<strong>Pattern Recognition</strong>, <strong>Clustering</strong>, and <strong>Trading</strong>.
						I implemented these algorithms in my personal
						projects and research using <strong>TensorFlow</strong>, <strong>Keras</strong>,
						<strong>PyTorch</strong>, and <strong>OpenCV</strong>.
					</p>

				<div class = "service">
					<h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>China National Finalist</strong> of the <strong>2020 Alibaba GET Global Challenge</strong>.
						I joined this competition with a group of friends, we worked on Frontiers of Health, a platform that aimed
						to offer high-quality & low-cost psychological services to students. Most recently, I have been working
						as an Ambassador of <strong>SciEcon</strong>, a non-profit organization at Duke and Duke Kunshan, by
						interviewing leaders in Economics and Engineering.

				<p>
					I am a rising senior majoring in Data Science at Duke Kunshan University. As part of a multidisciplinary program
					in China and the US, I have worked with professors of different areas such as History, Physics,
					and Economics.
				</p>
				<p>
					Aside from research, I am also involved SciEcon, which creates social media-content and symposiums
					in Economics, Blockchain, and Computer Science for students in the US and China.
				</p>
				<p>
					Due to the nature of my program I have acquired a wide variety of interests in History, Law,
					Economics, and Politics. I am very curious about the intersection and applications of Data Science
					and social sciences.
				</p>
				<p>
					On my free time I enjoy learning the piano and being part of political activism in Mexico.
