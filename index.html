					<h3>Data Science</h3>
					<p>I am studying the B.S. in Data Science at Duke Kunshan University. I have also
					worked on many personal projects and competitions where I was able to predict the
					stock market performance and analyse the economic impact of COVID-19 in the US.
					As a result, I have acquired proficiency in SQL, Python, and data science libraries
					such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit learn.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "service">
					<h3>AI & Machine Learning</h3>
					<p>AI & Machine Learning is a key part of my program, besides, I have completed
					the IBM specialization in AI Engineering. I am able to train and deploy Machine
					Learning algorithms for Object Detection, Image Recognition, Classification, Pattern
					Recognition, and Clustering. I have also implemented these algorithms in my personal
					projects and research using TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, and Keras.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "service">
					<h3>Research</h3>
					<p>I am currently working in a particle physics related project at the Duke Department
					of Physics with Fritz London Distinguished Professor Ashutosh V. Kotwal. We are working on the implementation
					of C/C++ AI algorithms directly into integrated circuiuts. The final purpose is to allow the
					Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN to detect the production of Dark Matter particles.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "service">
					<h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>
					<p>In 2020, my teammates and I were National Finalists of the Alibaba GET Global Challenge, this
					is a global competition for young entrepreneurs. Our project was Frontiers of Health, a platform
					that offers high-quality & low-cost psychological services to students. We are currently working
					on the development of the app and plan to launch our project within the coming year.</p>
